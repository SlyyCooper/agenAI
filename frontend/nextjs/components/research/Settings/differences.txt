Three-Way Comparison of Settings Components

1. Component Type and Framework Usage
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Class: Function component
- Framework: React with JavaScript
- Uses basic React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- WebSocket implementation included

Settings.tsx:
- Class: Function component
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- Uses Framer Motion for animations
- Simple settings toggle with modal

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Class: Function component
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- Uses Framer Motion and advanced UI components
- Complex tabbed interface with multiple settings

2. Purpose and Functionality
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Primary focus: WebSocket communication
- Handles agent logs and report generation
- Real-time updates and communication
- Basic form rendering for research tasks

Settings.tsx:
- Simple settings toggle button
- Basic modal display
- Single purpose: toggle settings visibility
- No complex state management

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Comprehensive research settings management
- Multiple setting categories (report type, source, files, tone)
- Rich UI with icons and animations
- Advanced state management for multiple settings

3. UI Components and Structure
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Basic container div
- ResearchForm component
- AgentLogs component
- Report component
- Simple HTML structure

Settings.tsx:
- Settings button with icon
- Motion-animated accordion
- Modal component integration
- Minimal UI elements

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Popover component
- Tabbed interface
- Grid layouts
- Motion animations
- Rich iconography
- Complex nested components

4. State Management
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Multiple useState hooks
- WebSocket state
- Agent logs state
- Report state
- Access data state

Settings.tsx:
- Single isOpen state
- Simple toggle functionality
- Props for settings and callbacks

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Complex settings object state
- Tab state management
- Multiple setting categories
- Prop-based settings updates

5. Props and Type Definitions
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Basic props: chatBoxSettings, setChatBoxSettings
- No TypeScript types
- Loose prop typing

Settings.tsx:
- TypeScript interface for props
- Basic props for settings toggle
- Simple prop structure

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Detailed props structure
- Strong type checking
- Complex prop relationships

6. Integration and Usage
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Legacy/unused component
- WebSocket-focused functionality
- More backend integration

Settings.tsx:
- Generic settings component
- Potentially unused or auxiliary
- Simple toggle functionality

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Actively used in research page
- Integrated with InputArea component
- Core functionality for research settings
- Modern implementation

7. Code Organization
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Mixed concerns (WebSocket + UI)
- Less structured
- No clear separation of concerns

Settings.tsx:
- Single responsibility
- Clear structure
- Minimal implementation

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Well-organized code
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular component structure
- Logical grouping of functionality

8. Modern Features
----------------------------------------
Settings.js:
- Basic React patterns
- Traditional WebSocket handling
- Standard JavaScript features

Settings.tsx:
- TypeScript support
- Basic animation support
- Modern React patterns

ResearchSettings.tsx:
- Modern React patterns
- Advanced UI components
- Rich animations
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Modern component composition

Conclusion:
ResearchSettings.tsx is clearly the most modern, actively used, and feature-rich implementation. It represents the current state of the application's settings functionality, while Settings.js appears to be a legacy component and Settings.tsx seems to be a simplified or generic version that might have been used as a template or in other parts of the application.
